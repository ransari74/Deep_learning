You might think Keras is easier to work, but you will be suprised about the user firendly interface Pytorch is providing. In additon, when you can customised your model, you can build model combined two deep neural network together. For instance, think about predicting stock using RNN, you might think other features like weekday would effect the stock price, so, you can build model to combine classifer resutl with RNN result and make prediction!! Do you think is it amazing, let start learning how to build the Pytorch model as easy as Keras."

There are three main structurs for Recurrent Neural Network cells:1.RNN, 2.GRU, 3.LSTM. Here, we will explain how to build RNN and LSTM using built-in pytorch function.

First, we will implement the RNN using the built-in library. Then we will build RNN model from the scratch with nn.module. Inside each RNN layer, there are several RNN cells with the number of sequence lenght. Inside each RNN cells, there are several neurons which define the hidden_size. For example, in image below (soruce:google): Number of features is 3 which are shown with orange circle, and number of neuraons (hidden_size) is 3 which are shown with blue circles. In RNN, there is two groups input for each cell, first, the input data from trainging sets, second, the hidden states. So, we need to define an initial hidden state. \n",
